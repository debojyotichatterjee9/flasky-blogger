<h2>About Flask</h2>
  <p class="lead">Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 
      It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.</p>
    <p class="lead"> It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components 
        where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.</p>
    <code>You can find the documentation here: <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" target="_blank">Flask Documentation</a></code>
